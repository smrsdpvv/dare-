	<p class="title"> Paint by numbers  - A community art experience</p>
	<p> House of sunshine, an artistic ensemble by sunshine house for House of T’s 5th anniversary and Dare was invited to be a part of this amazing event. And Our plan was to have people engage in art and have fun. </p>
	<p> But how can we encourage anyone irrespective of their age, skills and experiences to pick up a brush and paint? And How can we make a group of people to paint on the same piece of art? And we came up with Paint by numbers! Except on a larger scale. </p>

	<p> Paint-by-numbers is a simple fun activity where a picture is divided into numbered sections. Each number corresponds to a specific color, and the participant fills in the sections with the corresponding colors to create a finished painting.  </p>
	<p>With a huge leap of faith, we built a life-sized paint by numbers art installation on the theme “behind the scenes” - a piece inspired by the chaotic order of an artist’s brain.  </p>
</div>
	<p> While some were enthusiastic to participate in this, we also had people shy away feeling they may ruin it. This was familiar, ‘the need for perfectionism’ for us but with few words of encouragement even they couldn’t resist the joy of painting.  </p>
	<p> We realized, we are all kids at heart and you are never too old to pick up a brush and paint. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced artist, paint-by-numbers proved to be a fun way to explore people’s artistic side. </p>
